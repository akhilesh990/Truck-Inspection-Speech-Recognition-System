# Truck-Inspection-Speech-Recognition-System
This project is a voice-based truck inspection data collection system using Python and Speech Recognition. It allows inspectors to navigate a predefined menu, answer questions about truck inspections, and store responses in a structured JSON format.
Features
✅ Speech Recognition – Uses speech_recognition to capture and process voice input.
✅ Hands-Free Data Collection – Inspectors can respond verbally instead of manually entering data.
✅ Predefined Inspection Menu – Covers truck serial number, tire pressure, condition, and more.
✅ Session Continuation Prompt – Asks if the user wants to continue after each section.
✅ Structured JSON Output – Saves collected responses in answers.json.
